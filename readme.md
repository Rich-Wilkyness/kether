# Overview

My goal with this program is to practice implement my learning of Golang, Databases, and SQL. Some code is copy pasta for a more optimized website, but I understand how it works for the most part. Still working on understanding Go globals and file structure.
This program allows one to create a test, add questions to that test, and retrieve a test that will populate with the assigned questions. 

# How To Run

1. Download the repository
2. Ensure all dependencies are downloaded - you can do this by running go mod tidy and then 'go get (dependency)' if certain dependencies were not resolved - ex: go get github.com/Rich-Wilkyness/kether
2. Go to root directory and run "go run ./cmd/web" in the terminal

# Development Environment

1. Golang - backend
2. Boostrap - frontend 
3. PostgreSQL - for the database
4. DBeaver - GUI for database
5. https://gobuffalo.io/documentation/database/fizz/ - database migration
6. and many other dependencies in the go.mod file for authentication, routing, etc.
